## Welcome

Welcome to my little place on the interwebs.  In this website, I hope to detail you the scope of the project I am working on, and help relay some of the vision that I have in store for it.

## Who Are You?

[Who am I?](https://youtu.be/tf5nCPFBSHw)  My name is [Michael DeMond](https://github.com/Mike-EEE/), and I [turned 42](https://www.quora.com/Why-and-how-is-42-the-answer-to-life-the-universe-and-everything) on June 7th this year (2018).  

If you are in the MSFT ecosystem and frequent any of its blogs, then you have most likely seen me patrolling the comments of the posts there -- usually when the subject revolves around data formats, or .NET client application development -- under the nickname of Mike-EEE, a gamer tag that I acquired in the late 1990s and I have stuck with it through this day.  

I have been a .NET developer since 2001, since Visual Studio was in its first beta.  Before that, I was a PHP web developer and [first employee for a startup](https://www.wildtangent.com/) that was founded by [one of the creators of DirectX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_St._John).  The technology that this company initially dealt with -- [Chromeffects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Chrome) -- can, for all intents and purposes, be called the first version of Silverlight ([discussed below](/#what-in-the-world-is-this-project)).  From my efforts at this startup, you could say that I was well-rehearsed in JavaScript, XML, and, of course, HTML -- but more so with all their associated pains.  

It was there also that I stumbled upon the glory of .NET.

Since that time, I have worked for several software consultancies and then started my own small consultancy, which I run today but has been put on hold while I work now on this project and vision.

## What in the World is This Project?!

In my 17 years of .NET development, there was no other technology that I enjoyed as much as [Silverlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Silverlight).  If you are a storied .NET client application developer, then you are most likely in agreement with me that Silverlight was one of the best inventions of MSFT's storied legacy.  We all know, however, that Silverlight met its demise in 2011, after a very dubious on-stage performance by Steven Sinofsky tried to wow and impress an entire conference auditorium room packed full with MSFT developers with a _non-MSFT technology_, that of JavaScript and HTML5.  The results of which are still lore today (hint: it didn't go very well).

### Open Letter to .NET Platform Leadership

After the demise of Silverlight, I wrote an [open letter to .NET Platform Leadership](https://dotnetfuture.wufoo.com/forms/open-letter-net-client-platform-future-vision/).  It, of course, went ignored as I am a rather obscure developer, and was especially so at that time.  As I was not very adept with Twitter, nor did I have any significant following, this letter pretty much died on the vine, only capturing 35 signatures.

Ironically enough, this letter was a catalyst for forming around the idea of this project, as -- I hope to demonstrate below -- the vision contained within this letter is remarkably similar to the next phase of this journey.  I received a reminder about this letter when the recent DGPRmaggedon made its rounds.  I was struck with how similar my ask and desire for this "client model" was a full seven years ago.  It has inspired me to make the jump to create this project and dedicate my life to it for the very foreseeable future.

### Developers Win!

In October 2015, I created a website named "Developers Win!" that was dedicated to ideas that I had at the time, one of which was the request for a [Ubiquitous .NET Client Development Model](https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio-ide/suggestions/10027638-create-a-ubiquitous-net-client-application-develo).  At first, the resistance was thick as brick, but over time this vote gathered momentum and has turned into a bit of a movement, further leading into this project.  As it sits today at nearly 10,459 votes, this vote is the top of MSFT's UserVoice ecosystem as the most popular, active vote found anywhere.  You won't find a more popular vote out there.  I haven't, at least.

Developers Win! was a resource site that was used primarily to host content that further supplemented the votes that I created throughout MSFT's UserVoice ecosystem.  While those other votes were interesting, none of them gathered the type of steam that the Ubiquitous vote did.  In the spirit of [keeping things simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), I have decided to shut down Developers Win! and have folded its content into this project.  Furthermore, I have stopped my interest in the other votes that I have created there (although I will still participate if necessary).  My sole focus is now this project.

## So, What is This Project?

As I mentioned earlier, [the Ubiquitous vote](https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio-ide/suggestions/10027638-create-a-ubiquitous-net-client-application-develo) has turned into a bit of a movement.  There are over 480 comments that you can read through.  You can start at the start and count how many users said that this type of project would never, ever be possible.  This type of thinking still astounds me because the purpose of an _idea forum_ is to solicit _ideas_ and subsequent _inspiration_ from said ideas.  As I hope to highlight in the remaining sections of this site, inspiration is something that has been missing since the death of Silverlight and in our aggregate community as a whole.

In any case, you can further browse through these comments and -- shockingly enough -- you will find users who suggest that I do things such as attend MSFT shareholder meetings to call attention to this gigantic issue within our MSFT community.  I am not exactly good with these sorts of activities, nor do I think they are effective.  However, it did get me to start thinking about this space a little differently and has launched me to create this project and work on it full time.

## Are You Going to Answer the Question?
 
**Super.NET is my attempt to answer the very question that I created in October 2015, on my own terms.**
 
## You're Crazy
 
I agree.  I am actually a bit terrified I am even considering this.  However, given how the space has shaken out, and the different approaches to this very elusive and complicated problem, I have felt compelled to throw my own hat in the ring as there has been no attempts to solve this problem the way that I think it should be.
 
## You?  You Have a Team, Right?
 
I have always worked best on my own.  As [a wise developer](https://blog.superdotnet.run/2018/06/who-is-agent-smith/) once stated to me in paraphrase: *"show me something one developer can do in one month, and I will show you something two can do in two."* 

Very true words, and something that has afflicted most of our ecosystem as of late, in my view.
 
## You're Not Crazy -- YOU'RE INSANE!!!
 
Perhaps.  Consider that I have essentially stared into a series of flashing rectangles for over 22 years of my life now.  That will do some strange things to a person, I would suggest to you.

Regardless, in my view, software is like writing a book.  It's nearly impossible to write a book that is consistent in form and tone with multiple people stomping around in various chapters and trying to tie together a cohesive story.  Some teams do pull it off, however, and I rightfully salute them.  In my world, however, this is the exception and not the norm.  It's simply not my style or what I have found the most success at in my nearly 22 years of development experience.  In my view, a project should get to its first publish point and _then_ other members join to help flesh it out, keeping to the tone and style established by the primary author.

## OK Crazy Guy, How Are You Going to Pull Off the Impossible?

One day at a time.  But first, I have a lot of writing to do here in this site, and in doing so I hope to cover a lot of ground here.  I would like to think of this as a good stopping point in my career to reflect on my time so far in the .NET space, to share my lessons learned, and offer a bit of a retrospective.  I hope to establish this in the [Philosophy section](/philosophy/).  From there, I will explore the primary concepts of this project in the [Vision section](/vision/) to break down the major pieces and highlight how the approach differs from any others that I have seen in the marketplace to date.  From there, I hope to contain all further, unanswered questions in the [FAQ](/faq/), and from _there_, maintain any further thoughts or highlights worth sharing on the [Super.NET blog, dawg](https://blog.superdotnet.run).

Let's first jump into the [Philosophy section](/philosophy/).
