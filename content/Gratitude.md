A quick shout out to those in the community who have supported me in various forms, or who have encouraged me one way or another in this grand adventure that I now find myself in:

[Dr. Donald Robertson](https://www.patreon.com/djrobertson) (aka [Emperor Marcus Aurelius](https://www.facebook.com/MarcusAureliusEmperor/)): I saw Dr. Robertson's post in my feed for his Patreon account and was inspired to "make the jump" in my own pursuit here.

[Wojciech Nag√≥rski](https://github.com/wojtpl2): For putting out your answers on StackOverflow to get me in the right direction here.
