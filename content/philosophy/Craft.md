In the philosophy that is described here, it proposes that software development is a craft, much like wood working, pottery, beer, or -- as this section later calls out -- [jewelry](#compare).

## You Can't Spell Craft without Art

I'm a bit of a stickler and sucker for words.  I enjoy anagrams and things of that nature.  If you take the letters a-r-t out of craft, you end up with cf, [which doesn't make any sense](https://youtu.be/Qtqp-RUw87M).  Not to me, at least.

> *Craft* means building something with both *heart* and *art*.

Nonetheless, having this notion of being a "craftsperson" got me to go online and found this [nice discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/composer/comments/3zwl4l/discussion_is_music_a_craft_or_an_art/).  The takeaway -- as with *anything* that involves many human beings and their resulting points of view -- is that there are several ways of looking at craft.  For the purposes of this discussion, craft means building something with both *heart* and *art*.

Getting to know your art is very important in life.  In my view, you should have several outlets, with software being one of them.  I myself recently re-visited all of my art while [discovering Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and organized it all in a site that [you can view here](http://ossem.com/).  It has to be one of the most therapeutic activities I have ever done, and I certainly encourage anyone who has old art to do the same.  

Several observations from this activity:

1. It got me to identify [my heroes and influences](http://ossem.com/about/#heroes) in life.  This was satisfying and personally inspirational to me.
2. It unveiled my history to me.  This is key to me personally as it yielded a lot of inspiration (common theme here), but also reduced a lot of clutter in the background of my mind.  This is why I suggest you do the same so that you can find yours.
3. It organized my history.  I took creative liberties and organized my art history into [different boxes](http://www.ossem.com/about/#boxes).
4. It showed me my different types of art that interest me.  I have these now captured and organized by [poems](http://www.ossem.com/poems/), [stories](http://www.ossem.com/stories/), and [sketches](http://www.ossem.com/sketches/), which, incidentally, Hugo organizes perfectly by default.
5. It allowed me to discover explore another foreign yet elegant technology.  While at first glance it would seem to contradict myself in using a different technology than .NET, that is not the case at all.  In fact, I will be using Hugo as a great example of how we should be incorporating other inspiring features from other technologies into .NET.

## I'm in This for the Craft

After spending over two decades in software development, I can say that I am more about establishing legacy now as opposed to making a quick buck, and you can thank a recent close call with death for cementing this feeling within me.  

In the last week of May 2018, I was on my way back from my daily gym routine when I [encountered a terrible accident that claimed a life](http://www.ossem.com/stories/2018/grind/) which must have occurred no less than two minutes before I arrived on scene.

What was especially scary was that I had five minutes earlier to this event pushed myself on the treadmill to complete my sixty minutes rather than quit a few minutes early.  If I had done so, I would have no doubt been placed further in the window of this incident.

This was actually the motivating factor in creating my art project and exploring it in full.

It got me to think about what I want to be known for if I had died unexpectedly.  This is a notion that I have never been confronted with before, but I have had heard others face it in the past.  To me, I realized that if I had died today, people would know me, if anything, by [my code](http://github.com/Mike-EEE), but there is nothing particularly interesting there.  Further, they wouldn't know me by my writings, or if I did write at all.

But then it got me to think further of how I could use technology along with art, and that has led me to galvanizing this project -- which is not meant to specifically serve as art per se, but will allow applications that deal with such to be made accordingly, which is what I am building towards now.

So I guess you could say, since that experience, I am more of a [carpe diem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpe_diem) person and I am here to establish some more meaning in the world -- not just in what I produce, but [how I treat others as well](https://blog.superdotnet.run/2018/06/hello-world-welcome-to-super.net-blog-dawg/#brand).

## More  Jeweler, Less One Person Band{#compare}

When I lived in the Seattle area, I would walk [by a jeweler](http://bendersjewelers.com/) on my way to the gym for my daily workout.  I was always impressed with how intent he was in his activities, and it was easy to draw a comparison to how his intensity is a lot like a software developer when they are "in the zone."

![The intensity of a jeweler is very much like a software designer](/images/Jeweler.jpg "The intensity of a jeweler is very much like a software designer")

In my worldview, the jeweler is very much the "symbol" I envision when I describe software as being a craft: you have a student who is intently studying and working with their tools upon their gems and stones in pursuit of perfection, which are then, in turn, sold to provide elegance and further meaning into the world.

Conversely, taken from a typical business perspective, it always seems the goal here is to turn every developer into a one person band.  Their proud, all-to-common mantra of "a jack of all trades, master of none," seems to be a game of sorts to quote during job interviews and descriptions.

The problem here, of course, is that you soon have an entire team or even group of one person bands and getting them all to work together to produce a cogent, coherent product is exactly like what you would expect when you envision such a sight and subsequent sound.

You might note my "clown" example above actually doesn't sound too bad, and you are not wrong.  Pausing a bit further here, this is not [placing judgement on which approach is better](/philosophy/introduction/#quick-word-on-value-judgments), but simply expressing an *ideal personal style* and to delineate the difference in the two approaches.  I think we have plenty of one person bands in our world.  My desire is to see more *jewelers*, and that is the type of culture that I will be aiming for in establishing this project.

Additionally, it is also worth noting that the "clown" can be seen as an appropriate symbol for the workplace environment, whereby symbolizing the need to entertain and connect with others in the context of producing adequate revenues to sustain growth for the company for which they work.  As previously mentioned, this is not meant to say that this is "good" or "bad," but simply meant as an observation in the type of style that is currently employed within our ecosystem.

## Summary

In this article, I explored the craft of software and explored two different styles that facilitate this craft in the style of a jeweler and the one person band.  I then made a suggestion to see more jewelers made within our ecosystem where the focus is made more on the craft itself rather than on the focus of revenue and business.

Next, I explore the [business of art &raquo;](/philosophy/business-of-art/).
