# *[[WIP](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/workinprogress.asp)]

Fundamentally, the work we do is an art.  The business problem with art, of course, is that it is very difficult to produce money from it so that you can sustain yourself and put food on the table.  That is, unless you are an expert at the craft.  Further, one does not become an expert unless they have *invested a great deal of time* into their craft.  This, paired with skill, produces mastery.  In my discussion here, I will be angling for this ideal, whereby we are producing *masters* of our craft by promoting a culture of *experts* rather than generalists, which is the overwhelmingly expensive (and taxing) environment we find ourselves in our current, accepted climate.

True art cannot be rushed.  You cannot rush that which has its own mind.  It's like screaming at an unborn baby while still in its warm womb to hurry up and eject itself.  The types of projects that I have contracted and worked at over the years very much feel like this type of thinking.

Not only is screaming ineffective, it causes undue stress to the person carrying the baby (the artist in this case), the person doing the screaming, and of course the baby itself -- if not by its own intuition of negative energy, but by proxy its host which has to endure the energy by being exposed to it.

### The Business Problem

I, of course, express an ideal.  The problem is that we find ourselves in an environment where we are constantly screaming at our unborn babies to hurry up their delivery schedule.  I would posit that our resulting quality speaks for itself for a large part -- if not all -- of these cases.

Even worse, this behavior is rewarded financially so it is enabled as if it were an addiction -- and by all intents and purposes, *it is.*

So, how do we combat this problem?  Unfortunately I have no panacea here.  Not yet, at least.  I envision a world where all artists are able to work full time on their visions and make enough to at least feed themselves -- much like I will be able to do with mine here for a few years.  Even still, in my case a few years there is still a limitation that I would like to see removed.

#### Cryptocurrency?

The interesting aspect of cryptocurrency at present is its *raw potential* towards solving some of these types of problems.  I have been studying this space for about a year now.  I would like to think that it's a part of what I am building here.  The problem here is the details and the time required to acquire the required knowledge.  The ideal is not to exactly disrupt systems as they currently stand -- [thereby fostering ill will](https://blog.superdotnet.run/2018/06/hello-world-welcome-to-super.net-blog-dawg/#even-when-you-re-right-you-can-be-wrong), but to work within established boundaries and *innovate them accordingly*.

There is still a lot of unknown in this space, of course.  It's a bit "quantum" (that is, not fully understood) in its own right.  But, there is potential here and enough to keep in mind as we build forward with the vision I am describing here.

### The Jeweler vs. One Person Band

When I lived in the Seattle area, I would walk [by a jeweler](http://bendersjewelers.com/) on my way to the gym for my daily workout.  I was always impressed with how intent he was in his activities, and I was always quick to draw a comparison to how his intensity is a lot like a software developer when they are "in the zone."

![The intensity of a jeweler is very much like a software designer](/images/Jeweler.jpg "The intensity of a jeweler is very much like a software designer")

In my worldview, the jeweler is very much the "symbol" I envision when I describe software as being a craft.  You have a student who is intently studying and working with their tools upon their gems and stones in pursuit of perfection, which in turn provides elegance and further meaning into the world.

Conversely, taken from a typical business perspective, it always seems their goal is to turn every developer into a one person band.  Their proud mantra is the all-to-common "a jack of all trades, master of none."  Incidentally, this serves as a fun drinking game for every time you hear it in an interview or read it in a job description.

The problem here, of course, is that you soon have an entire team or even group of one person bands and getting them all to work together to produce a cogent, coherent product is exactly like what you would expect for the most part.

[![When You Know HTML5, and CSS and PHP and JavaScript and C# and Java and ...](http://img.youtube.com/vi/zu711IAYjHg/0.jpg "When You Know HTML5, and CSS and PHP and JavaScript and C# and Java and ...")](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zu711IAYjHg)(When You Know HTML5, and CSS and PHP and JavaScript and C# and Java and ...)

Pausing a bit here, this is not [placing judgement on what is better](/philosophy/introduction/#quick-word-on-value-judgments), but simply expressing an ideal and to delineate the difference in approach.  This difference is also further explored in [culture](/philosophy/culture/) where I examine and explain in business terms why I prefer the jeweler (expert) over the one person band (generalist).

## It's Done When It's Done

I have always respected and appreciated those projects that took guts to take the required and necessary time to work on their projects with the attention it deserved.  This section serves as a little shout to my heroes here in their efforts to go against the grain and work on their product until it was completed to their satisfaction.

Each one of these have their own story on how they have combatted timelines.  Each one of these stories does not have an overwhelmingly happy or successful theme to them, either.  My point in exploring these is not to provide a solution, but to highlight that there isn't one.  This is a very difficult problem to solve but I have a hunch if a good amount of ingenuity, creativity, and innovation is applied, then a sort of compromise can be had.

I go through these from best to worst in success.

#### Prophet Comic 

[Prophet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophet_(comics)) has to be my favorite comic of all time.  I am speaking of course to the old skool one, the one released in the 90's by [Rob Liefeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Liefeld) and drawn by the legendary Stephen Platt (easily my most favorite artist of all time).

The problem, though, is that there turned out to be a huge problem with -- can you guess? -- timelines imposed on Platt which resulted in [a rift between him and Liefeld](https://www.bleedingcool.com/2014/01/20/fanboy-rampage-rob-liefeld-vs-stephen-platt/).  The story here can easily be related to the problem space that I am describing.  Reading this story in detail reveals some very interesting aspects of Platt's thinking that I can personally appreciate.  Likewise, as a business owner, I also appreciate Liefeld's position as well: you get paid, you do the job, bruh.

The happy ending here is that Prophet [went back into circulation as a revival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophet_(comics)#Image_revival_(2012)) and each issue was released when it was done, not by arbitrary deadlines.  [It also happened to be a very highly-valued and appreciated comic](https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/01/10-reasons-why-brandon-grahams-prophet-is-the-best.html) as a result.

Any surprises there?

#### Hero U

[Hero U](http://hero-u.com/hero-u-donations/kickstarter/) is a game made by the same creatives that penned the [Quest for Glory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_for_Glory) series (probably my favorite PC game outside of [DooM\]\[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_II)).

This is a custom-rolled initiative that has been going since 2012, and you can read all the gory (glory?) [details here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/transolargames/hero-u-rogue-to-redemption/updates).  It really underscores the complexity of software.  However, they are in beta now after plugging at it for nearly six years and are ever so closer to a release.  You have to tip your hat to them for sticking with it and continuing forward especially after going through so many deadlines and facing so many challenges.

#### Duke Nukem 4Ever

The last example I have is one that started out a champion for "it's done when it's done," but after a while it sort of turned into a joke.  [Duke Nukem 4Ever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Nukem_Forever#Development) is a title that ended up living up to its name in a negative way, being that it took forever to finally launch. 

I bring it up here because I think it's important to analyze what went wrong and where.  Whereas Hero U has continued to chug along at a respectable pace, with its owners fully engaged and responsive with its community, Duke Nukem 4Ever started out hot and then seemed to grow despondent and murky.

To me, what stands out is the basic issue here is *hunger*.  Duke Nukem 3D was an overwhelming success.  With success comes power, and how you handle that power is truly what defines how successful you truly are.  It's easy to get distracted with such resources and ability, and I believe that's what ultimately happened here.

You still have to give respect to the entire crew (or crews) behind this project a lot of credit for finally kicking this thing out the door, despite its struggles and resulting quality.

#### Others?

If you yourself know of any examples of daring attempts to face the challenge of arbitrary deadlines,  please feel free to share them in the comments below.

## Summary

In this article, I explored the craft of software, namely by exploring the tedious and challenging relationship between art and deadlines -- where innovation meets business.  As there are no easy answers to this nearly impossible problem within a capitalist framework, the goal was to present my idea of a craftsperson and the resulting trade of software as a craft in its own right.  I then explored some known examples of projects combating the challenge of deadlines, which represent the limits of resources applied to a particular objective.

Next, I explore the notion of [simplicity in design&raquo;](/philosophy/simple-does-it/).
