## What is Super.NET?

Super.NET enables ubiquitous applications written in .NET.

## What is a Ubiquitous .NET Application?

A ubiquitous application is one that can run anywhere on any device.  Super.NET aims to enable this for .NET applications comprised of a *single* codebase that creates applications that runs within the web browser.

## Like [Silverlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Silverlight) Did?

Yes.

## Will You Ever Stop Whining About That?

Are you... [whining about my whining](https://youtu.be/EL8e2ujXe8g)?

## That's Very Meta of You.

That wasn't a question.

## I'm... Sorry?

Apology accepted.

## World Peace, Brogrammer.  What If I Have More Questions?

This document will be updated as common questions arise, which, to be quite honest *shouldn't happen until the first version is done*.  I am trying to keep this low-key as possible in hopes to maximize its chance of success.  More visibility means more expectations which is bad, mkay?  In fact, I really shouldn't have this site up already and am a bit uncomfortable with it, [but that is where the magic happens](https://artandcakela.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/kris-comfort-zone-postcard-side1-1.jpg), right?

You can also find me on our [Super.NET Blog, Dawg](https://blog.superdotnet.run/).  I will (hopefully)  be posting updates there as I progress, or regress.  Whichever.
