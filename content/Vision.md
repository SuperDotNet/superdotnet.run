Having now [described the overarching philosophy and goals](/philosophy/) driving Super.NET, we now turn our attention to its overall vision and how it intends on fulfilling its objectives.

## Primary Components

A list of the big components that will be required to build the vision here.

### Serializer

As discussed in principle and objectives, [many data formats](#data-formats) will be used within this framework.  Therefore, the serializer must be able to account for these formats and more.  We will be building upon the work done on [ExtendedXmlSerializer](https://extendedxmlserializer.github.io/) to facilitate and actualize this goal.

### WebSocket Bridge

The [WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) bridge is what enables this vision to work.  HTML is sent over to the client, and then a WebSocket is then used to provide any further updates to the state as presented on the client to the server to keep them synchronized.

### Control Suite

This is a big effort, and one that I envision being a community effort after the foundation has been placed and we have a better idea of the overall structure of the project and necessary classes.  The goal here being all the necessary controls required to build a "typical" web page.  This, of course, is an encompassing definition and will need to be outlined accordingly.

### Visual Designer

This is another considerable effort and again one that I envision being more of a community effort.  In the vision here, we want to strive for the .NET equivalent to [Webflow](https://webflow.com/), which I consider to be a superb HTML editor that provides an exemplary user experience.  The goal, of course, is to provide the same excellence but for the .NET elements that are used here in Super.NET.
