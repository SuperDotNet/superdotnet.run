      <description>*[WIP] A quick shout out to those in the community who have supported me in various forms, or who have encouraged me one way or another in this grand adventure that I now find myself in:
Dr. Donald Robertson (aka Emperor Marcus Aurelius): I saw Dr. Robertson&amp;rsquo;s post in my feed for his Patreon account and was inspired to &amp;ldquo;make the jump&amp;rdquo; in my own pursuit here.
Wojciech Nag√≥rski: For putting out your answers on StackOverflow to get me in the right direction here.</description>

      <description>*[WIP] What is Super.NET? Super.NET enables ubiquitous applications written in .NET.
