<p>This is mostly inspired by the comments of the <a href="https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/10027638-create-a-ubiquitous-net-client-application-develo">issue that I created in October 2015</a>, where there are a few comments that mention creating a Kickstarter.  As creating an entire fundraising effort around this seems to be outside of my comfort zone, I have instead setup what I like to call <strong>The Honor Jar</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="the-elevator-pitch">The Elevator Pitch</h2>

<p>This is how it works:</p>

<ol>
<li>You provide a donation to me, in exchange for a claim to one of my <a href="http://www.ossem.com">works of art </a>.</li>
<li>I work towards building Super.NET&rsquo;s first application: a digital art exchange.</li>
<li>If all goes well, your claim of art converts to a token which you can then sell on the digital art exchange.</li>
</ol>

<p>I call it an <em>honor fund</em> as it is set up as a <em>donation</em> by design, which means no guarantees of success but <em>my word</em> that it will happen unless one of the <a href="#risks">identified risks</a> occur.</p>

<h2 id="my-story">My Story</h2>

<p>I am currently dedicating the next two years of my life to building Super.NET and its first application: a digital art exchange.  Although I do not think it will take <em>that</em> long, I am sticking to my strong feeling and internal philosophy that <a href="/philosophy/business-of-art/#the-business-problem">you simply cannot rush art</a>.</p>

<h3 id="my-schedule">My Schedule</h3>

<p>I work <em>every</em> day for about 10 hours, or around 70 hours a week.  I spend about three hours every day working out, one of those hours of which is on the treadmill at speeds ranging 3.5-7MPH, averaging at about 5 miles per day.  I have been running for nearly a decade now, but this schedule has been in place for the past two years and I feel that I am &ldquo;in the zone&rdquo; in regard to this.</p>

<h3 id="my-finances">My Finances</h3>

<p>With current investments and financial standing, I have <em>zero</em> consumer and business debt (and going for six years now) and my operating expenses are about $7,500 per year.</p>

<h3 id="my-runway">My Runway</h3>

<p>At this current burn rate, I have about 3-4 years of runway at present, so, plenty of room and time.  The problem being, however, is that it&rsquo;s still burning my own capital and I would rather not do that if I can help it.  I would rather accept donations for now and find a way of providing value back to those who donate in return.</p>

<h2 id="the-honor-jar">The Honor Jar</h2>

<p>So how does this work?  It starts by providing a cryptocurrency donation to me.</p>

<p>What do you get in return for your donation?  Well, if you like <a href="http://www.ossem.com/">something from my art page</a>, I will make you a sponsor for that work, meaning a claim goes to show that you have sponsored it, along with the amount that you donate.</p>

<p>You essentially sponsor the art that is there for now, and in turn provide capital so that I can undertake the efforts required here.</p>

<p>Now, what sits there currently on that site is currently <em>my</em> art, but I would like to extend this to build a <em>digital art exchange</em> that allows me (and other artists) to register and sell their art in a way that works much like what you see on <a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/faq">Crypto Kitties</a> along with a few other ideas that I have thought about developing into it.</p>

<p>This is what I will be building as the first &ldquo;application&rdquo; to Super.NET&rsquo;s &ldquo;framework.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By providing a donation, you can claim a work of art from my art site.  If and when I get this exchange built, this claim will convert to a token.  Then &ndash; if and when the exchange is built &ndash; you will be able to sell it on this digital art exchange either immediately or at a later date which <em>may</em> or <em>may not</em> be worth something, <em>such as art goes</em>.  My hope is that you are able to recover your donated value <em>plus a return</em> upon sale of this claim token on this digital art exchange.</p>

<p>I say <strong>if</strong> and speak in <em>vague possibilities</em> here because <em>there are risks involved</em> as with any venture.  I am calling this the <strong>Honor Jar</strong> as it is based on a donation to me and <em>I am giving my word to you</em> that I will do everything I can to see to it that you see value returned back to you, but it is not a guarantee or promise.</p>

<p>Accordingly, there are risks that could interfere with my well-intended plans.  In the spirit of being forthright and <a href="https://youtu.be/muc7xqdHudI">doing the right thing</a>, I will now outline the risks that I have identified, followed by the potential rewards, and then provide the opportunity to donate if you still feel inclined.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s check out the <a href="/honor/risks/">risks&raquo;</a> or if you are already in it to win it, jump straight to <a href="/honor/donate/">donate now&raquo;</a>.</p>
