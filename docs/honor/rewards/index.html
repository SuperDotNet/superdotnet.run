<p>Whew!  I don&rsquo;t know about you, but that was <em>rough</em> digging through all that grit.  Looking at what can go wrong in life is <em>never</em> a fun exercise but I think it is the prudent and mature thing to do if I am asking for your money.</p>

<p><strong>Now for the good part.</strong>  Let&rsquo;s talk about how your donation would contribute to the world.</p>

<h3 id="you-support-net">You Support .NET</h3>

<p>.NET is the Commodore 64 that didn&rsquo;t die.  It&rsquo;s easily the greatest invention out of MSFT during it&rsquo;s grand and enduring history.  It&rsquo;s been around for nearly 20 years and MSFT continues to put the brightest talent into its gears and it has continued to adapt and improve over the years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>.NET is the Commodore 64 that didn&rsquo;t die.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the addition of F# shows, it has been designed to consider improvements or different ways of thinking about expressing CPU instructions, and has incorporated these new paradigms <em>successfully</em>.  <em>Meaning, future languages can also be incorporated as our field evolves.</em></p>

<h3 id="you-support-efficient-business-practices">You Support Efficient Business Practices</h3>

<p>Super.NET is meant to improve and streamline how .NET client applications are made, reducing the amount of code and complexity as opposed to today&rsquo;s guidance.  <a href="/vision/#the-business-problem">Read this</a> for more details.</p>

<h3 id="you-support-the-artists">You Support The Artists</h3>

<p>Technically, I would classify myself as a <em>hungry</em> artist &ndash; not quite starving (of which I am very thankful and lucky), but incredibly <em>hungry</em> to be of value, as well as to find and provide meaning back into the world.</p>

<p>At my core, I consider myself an artist.  Maybe not a great one, but one nonetheless who appreciates other art and would like to find a way to contribute back to it.  I hope my <a href="/philosophy/">articles on my underlying beliefs</a> help demonstrate this.</p>

<p>Further, I hope the efforts here attract those <em>other</em> artists who believe and feel like me about art, and that contributions can also go to them if necessary during this time at the very least.  <em>At the very most</em> we are able to build a digital art exchange that might change the way art is bought and sold online.</p>

<h3 id="you-support-innovation">You Support Innovation</h3>

<p>I would like to think that some of the ideas that I have are innovative.  <a href="/philosophy/culture/#purpose">Some are indeed a little crazy</a>, but that is what disruption looks like at times &ndash; and it is also part of the creative process, I would say.</p>

<p><em>I cannot promise anything</em> &ndash; because a <em>lot</em> can happen in a few years and making promises is a dangerous activity that is just begging for trouble, in my experience &ndash; but I have a few ideas that I have been percolating upon and I would like to think that they could be built and actualized on this foundation that is being built here with Super.NET.</p>

<p>Some of them, if executed properly, are what I would classify as &ldquo;disruptive.&rdquo;  That is all I will say for now.</p>

<h3 id="you-support-cryptocurrency">You Support Cryptocurrency</h3>

<p>Along with innovation, you get to see in action and partake of a <em>positive use of cryptocurrency</em>.  Additionally, others may start thinking in this <em>positive</em> way as well.</p>

<h3 id="you-support-michigan">You Support Michigan</h3>

<p>In my view, Michigan is going through a bit of a down time, compared to its glory days.  I would like to see innovation return Michigan, especially along the lines of cryptocurrency.  That is all I will say for now.</p>

<h3 id="you-support-me">You Support Me</h3>

<p>Lastly, you support me, <em>a virtual unknown</em>.  That is kind of bold, but very noble of you.  I will do everything I can to ensure that your act of charity is handled appropriately and further still to see that value is returned to you in some way.  Do know that this is the <em>first</em> time I have ever asked for donations in my life and I truly hope it is the <em>last</em>.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
