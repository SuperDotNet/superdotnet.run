<p>The idea here is are providing a <em>donation</em> towards a service that I am building upon Super.NET that <em>possibly</em> could return value back to you in the form of a token that can be sold as value later on if this endeavor completes successfully.  As with any business venture, there are <em>risks</em> to be aware of, even if this is <em>simply a donation</em>.  I am keeping a list of possible scenarios that would interfere with that success here.</p>

<h3 id="i-may-die">I May Die</h3>

<p>Chances: Negligible (&lt; 3%)</p>

<p>This is a super brutal yet incredibly real possibility.  The whole reason I am even on this course is that I recently had what I call a brush with death that <a href="/philosophy/craft/#i-m-in-this-for-the-craft">I discuss at more length here</a>.  Even so, it wasn&rsquo;t even a &ldquo;brush,&rdquo; but more of a miss by a few minutes, which was <em>enough to spook me</em> and put me on the path where you are now currently able to read this.</p>

<p>Carpe diem, my friend.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpe_diem">Carpe diem</a>.</p>

<h3 id="i-may-burn-out">I May Burn Out</h3>

<p>Chances: Negligible (&lt; 3%)</p>

<p>I do not consider this a significant possibility, but again, it <em>could</em> happen.  If anything, I take a little lull.  A good example is my recent run-in with an <a href="https://blog.superdotnet.run/2018/05/investigating-weird-result-times-in-benchmark-net/">extraordinarily complex performance issue</a> that took a tremendous amount of energy to solve.  I actually have not gone back to coding since that time as I have been busy with my <a href="http://ossem.com/">art project</a> and this site here.</p>

<p>For reference, I had another incident like this occur last year when I had to spend a good part of summer cleaning and organizing family belongings, which was what I would consider a &ldquo;once in a lifetime event,&rdquo; sort of like this adventure that I am on now.</p>

<p>I would say a good measure of my productivity and progress is demonstrated by my work with the <a href="https://github.com/wojtpl2/ExtendedXmlSerializer">ExtendedXmlSerializer</a>.  My first commit was <a href="https://github.com/wojtpl2/ExtendedXmlSerializer/commit/de11c86d3122d71ef451750f32b26a0e20891509">November 26th, 2016</a> and it didn&rsquo;t ship until <a href="https://github.com/wojtpl2/ExtendedXmlSerializer/tree/v2.0.0">November 17th, 2017</a>.  I mostly worked fulltime on that project with the schedule described above during this time minus a few client obligations with my business as well as a two-week vacation.</p>

<h3 id="i-may-quit">I May Quit</h3>

<p>Chances: Negligible (&lt; 3%)</p>

<p>I have never quit on any business venture in my life that had value to me.  It simply is not my nature.  I chalk it up to being taught to finish every plate of food in front of me.  It&rsquo;s good training for life.  In the slight event that this does occur, I would like to think that I would find a way to pass this project off to a custodian along with remaining funds so that it will continue.</p>

<h3 id="i-may-lose-interest">I May Lose Interest</h3>

<p>Chances: Negligible (&lt; 3%)</p>

<p>The only thing I can point you to is the <a href="/#open-letter-to-net-platform-leadership">open letter I wrote in 2011</a> that basically outlined exactly what this project can do now.  That&rsquo;s <em>seven</em> years ago.  I can further point you to the vote that I established nearly three years ago which <a href="https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio-ide/suggestions/10027638-create-a-ubiquitous-net-client-application-develo">now sits as the most popular vote</a> in all of the MSFT feedback ecosystem.  From that, I am apt to say that I am not going anywhere, but who knows, maybe I will wake up one morning and <em>inexplicably</em> go:</p>

<p>¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯ &ldquo;Meh&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which reminds me&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="i-may-get-swept-away-by-a-black-swan-event">I May Get Swept Away by a Black Swan Event</h3>

<p>Chances: Negligible (&lt; 3%)</p>

<p>I am putting this up there to account for the unthinkable.  A corporation could sweep in and offer me a job doing something somewhere and I drop this altogether.  This seems absurd to me because I could get a job instantly making money right now and I am doing this instead as I feel this is way more important.</p>

<p>Or, I could win the lottery and have more money than I ever know how to handle.  That seems a bit silly because I would tend to think I would use that money to ensure the efforts here get completed and I honor those that support me.</p>

<p>Maybe I get swept up by aliens and never return?  That is basically covered under &ldquo;I may die,&rdquo; so not that.  Not sure what else, which is why it&rsquo;s called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory">Black Swan</a> and why I am simply leaving it as an identified possibility.</p>

<h3 id="another-project-that-does-the-exactly-same-thing-but-better-emerges">Another Project That Does the Exactly Same Thing but Better Emerges</h3>

<p>Chances: More Real than Not (&gt; 50%)</p>

<p>Microsoft might take a cue and finally put something together.  Someone could get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/René_Girard#Mimetic_desire">further inspired and one-up me in full</a>, complete with a decked-out rock star team to show me just how wrong I am in my thinking and approach of <a href="/philosophy/craft/#craft">preferring jewelers to these one-person-bands</a>.</p>

<p>All of these are very real possibilities.  What&rsquo;s important to me is that the art exchange is created and that my art goes on sale there, along with other artists who can do the same.  I also have some key ideas about this exchange as well that are required.  I would have to examine the competing ideas and make decisions accordingly.  I would further make these decisions on ensuring donors getting value back if I can help it.</p>

<p>But the way that I see it, I have been talking about this space for about three years now and &ndash; even with <a href="https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/10027638-create-a-ubiquitous-net-client-application-develo">so much interest</a> &ndash; no one has seemingly listened to what I have had to say about it (or rather, <em>act upon it</em>), so this might actually be a non-issue and not one that I am entirely worried about yet.</p>

<h3 id="i-may-get-overwhelmed">I May Get Overwhelmed</h3>

<p>Chances: Possible (&lt; 25%)</p>

<p>A part of me is cringing at the whole notion of going through all this trouble to even declare what I am working on, and considers it probably the most foolish thing I have ever done.  <a href="https://blog.superdotnet.run/2018/06/who-is-agent-smith/">Agent Smith</a> would not approve, either.</p>

<p>The risk, of course, is that I get focused on other activities rather than <em>coding</em> which is where I feel I should be and find a great deal of joy in life &ndash; when the code actually finally works, that is.  If others join up and want to help out, then these sorts of things become a real potential as a legitimate distraction to have to manage.  However, I would prefer that I stick to keeping things simple and ensure that I build out the necessary, core pieces first and then bring others on to help flesh them out.</p>

<h3 id="i-may-not-meet-the-schedule">I May Not Meet the Schedule</h3>

<p>Chances: Possible (&lt; 25%)</p>

<p>This is the biggest risk, in my mind.  It may take longer than two years to build this vision.  It is incredibly ambitious and I have an especially particular vision for it so that means that I will be building it personally.  However, if enough donors contribute to provide enough additional runway, then it&rsquo;s back to being a matter of time and managing other risks.  As long as you are OK with me working at my own pace with the schedule I outline above and eventually launch <em>even if that takes longer than originally expected</em>, then so am I.</p>
