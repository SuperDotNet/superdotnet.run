<h1 id="wip-https-www-investopedia-com-terms-w-workinprogress-asp">*[<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/workinprogress.asp">WIP</a>]</h1>

<p>&ldquo;Introduction to philosophy&rdquo; sounds like a course we&rsquo;re about to take.  Well, perhaps it is.  I guess we&rsquo;re about to take a course into my philosophy, and I am about to put it in writing rather than having all these thoughts <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/alka-dhillon/dont-let-anyone-rent-space-in-your-head-for-free_b_5968192.html">live in my head without paying for rent</a>.</p>

<p>Primarily, this will serve as a guide not only to how I have been thinking about software development &ndash; and indeed, perhaps life itself &ndash; for years now, but it aims to establish how I wish others who may wish to joining at some point to assist in the efforts here to think as well.  In addition to software, it will get into the &ldquo;guts&rdquo; of how I view life on a fundamental as well.</p>

<p>As I have been developing software for over twenty years now, you will find the overarching philosophy that I have found works best with my approach in here, as well as that which has yielded the most success.</p>

<h2 id="quick-word-on-value-judgments">Quick Word on Value Judgments</h2>

<p>Before diving into the subject, I think it&rsquo;s appropriate to have a quick word on what might be perceived as value judgements within my communication.  That is, in describing my approach, the tendency is to say or perhaps infer that my suggested approach is &ldquo;better than&rdquo; or &ldquo;above&rdquo; another.  This is not my intent these days, but I will say that was certainly my state of mind at one point in my younger years.</p>

<p>What I have learned is that there are a multitude of ways to approach a problem.  You have to learn what works best for you and you alone, all the while making sure that it&rsquo;s <em>your</em> path.</p>

<p>Having your own voice is key here, one that is free to express itself without limits <em>so that it is truly authentic</em>.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s also important is that we <a href="https://blog.superdotnet.run/2018/06/hello-world-welcome-to-super.net-blog-dawg/#respect-every-opinion">respect other opinions and approaches</a>, even if and when that opinion differs from your own.  Be receptive to feedback and change.  This was an especially difficult lesson for me, especially after Silverlight was discontinued (which I address in the next section).</p>

<p>The way I look at it &ndash; we are talking philosophy here, after all: we are all here on this planet to &ldquo;carve out our own soul&rdquo; in this realm.  It&rsquo;s a bit of a &ldquo;soul space&rdquo; for lack of a better expression.</p>

<p>To offer a crude metaphor that I have been working with lately: imagine being an alien on a planet somewhere and you have visited an arcade or maybe even a carnival of sorts, where a machine is offered to you to put a coin in it so that you can have your &ldquo;human soul&rdquo; described to you.  This is perhaps analogous to <a href="https://youtu.be/FQ0sHPD5JMg">visiting a fortune teller at a carnival found on this planet</a>.</p>

<p>What I would like to think is that you are now that alien visiting this realm, visiting this place and <em>etching out your soul</em> accordingly.</p>

<p>Not just you, <em>but others as well</em>.  Now consider that this &ldquo;alien&rdquo; could, in fact, be a creature that manifests itself as 7 billion &ldquo;human cells&rdquo; (and other &ldquo;animals&rdquo;) as part of a greater organism.  We all <em>seem</em> autonomous, but are we <em>really</em>?  Are we really so separate?  Could it be that the same life force is cycling and oscillating between these 7 billion &ldquo;cells&rdquo; every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_time">Planck second</a>?  Or perhaps even faster as such?</p>

<p>Consider that we live in a realm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_a_distance">where dots of space can instantly share information with each other no matter the distance</a>.  We currently have no grasp or full understanding &ndash; nor are we anywhere near close to it &ndash; on these &ldquo;dots of space&rdquo; within our own brains and what information they are sharing with other &ldquo;places&rdquo; within the Universe (or elsewhere) which could, in fact, <em>be other human brains</em>.</p>

<p>Rounding back to the important point here and one relevant to software, is that if we are all connected in this way, we should also put this into perspective when we relate to each other.  More specifically, we should be mindful for <a href="https://blog.superdotnet.run/2018/06/hello-world-welcome-to-super.net-blog-dawg/#choose-your-energy-carefully">when we treat each other with negative energy</a>.  Even further, consider that when you denigrate or cast down aspersions upon another human being or &ldquo;fellow cell,&rdquo; you are actually doing it to a part of your greater self which, for all intents and purposes of the reasoning here, <em>is actually you</em>.</p>

<p>Highly philosophical and metaphysical, sure, but this is a section about philosophy so quite appropriate.  As I hope to highlight further in this section, this project is not about making a quick buck or looking to achieve &ldquo;<a href="https://blog.superdotnet.run/2018/06/who-is-agent-smith/">nerd popularity</a>,&rdquo; but more about ensuring that we <a href="https://youtu.be/uqI9gvZMOGo">do the right thing</a> and establish a <em>legacy</em> &ndash; that of <em>enduring .NET excellence</em>.  Not just in the software we build, but also in how we treat each other.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are not wrong answers here, only decisions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That being said, if others are themselves carving out their own soul in the same manner that I am, then <em>who am I to judge them</em>?  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf5nCPFBSHw">Who am I</a> to state that their soul &ndash; or rather, <em>their decisions</em> in carving out their design as such &ndash; is better or worse than mine?  This is a big epiphany of mine lately and thought I would share it here, for better or for worse.</p>

<p>There are not wrong answers here, only decisions.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>In this introduction, I skipped the pleasantries and introduced you directly into my rabbit hole of philosophical thinking.  If you&rsquo;ve made it this far, then you are some strange cat, and I welcome you for that.</p>

<p>Bad jokes (I think?) aside, I explored some fundamental issues that I face as a human being.  Going forward should be a breeze, right?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s find out as I next explore the <a href="/philosophy/inspiration/">role of inspiration&raquo;</a>.</p>
