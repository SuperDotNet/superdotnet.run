<h1 id="wip-https-www-investopedia-com-terms-w-workinprogress-asp">*[<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/workinprogress.asp">WIP</a>]</h1>

<p>In our final section here, we examine the ideal culture that we want to build around the philosophy that is being described here.  In describing software as a craft, <a href="/philosophy/craft/#compare">I made a comparison</a> between a &ldquo;one person band&rdquo; and a &ldquo;jeweler,&rdquo; suggesting that we should be striving for more jewelers in the world than one person bands.</p>

<p>In this section, I take this further to demonstrate why the jeweler model is preferred, and why it can lead to our goal as a culture of experts.  Let&rsquo;s first start by diving into what we mean by experts and generalists.</p>

<h2 id="experts-vs-generalists">Experts vs. Generalists</h2>

<p>You might have heard about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)">10,000 hour rule</a> and why it is <a href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/3027564/scientists-debunk-the-myth-that-10000-hours-of-practice-makes-you-an-expert">no longer considered</a> a valid measure of what constitutes an expert.  While it has been &ldquo;debunked,&rdquo; I still like to refer to it here for the purposes of this discussion, which is describing an expert of a particular skill or craft.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter how many hours are used.  It could be 20,000 or 30,000 hours.  What matters is that the person undertaking those hours can be considered an <em>expert</em> in a provided craft &ndash; in this case .NET &ndash; once they hit those hours that are required to become that expert.</p>

<p>If a person is spending half of their time learning .NET and then half of their time also learning JavaScript (or PHP or GO), then they have to spend <strong>twice</strong> as much time becoming an expert in any one of those fields because their attention has been <strong>divided</strong> and therefore becomes <strong>inefficient</strong>.  This is the definition of a <em>generalist</em> for the sake of this discussion presented here.</p>

<p>In our mission here, what we&rsquo;re aiming for is a world where those 10,000 (or whatever is required) hours are <em>exclusively</em> dedicated to .NET and its supporting ecosystem of technologies.  We want the developer squarely within .NET technologies for the <em>entirety</em> of their development (from both a personal and product perspective).  The more time they are within the <em>same</em> system, the <em>faster</em> they can achieve expert level on their own terms with this specific craft &ndash; that being .NET.  The faster they achieve expert level, the faster that they can yield their highest value not only to the ecosystem that has trained them, but to <em>themselves</em> as we will see in a bit.</p>

<h4 id="javascript-s-drag">JavaScript&rsquo;s Drag</h4>

<p>Of course, we do not live in this reality.  Currently, we must split our client development time in JavaScript and HTML5 &ndash; but specifically JavaScript as it is the language that is ultimately interfacing with the HTML5 DOM.  JavaScript is <em>completely incompatible</em> with .NET, so <em>any</em> work that is accomplished there cannot be leveraged in the .NET space.  This means each and every developer is spending <strong>twice</strong> the amount of time:</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing code</li>
<li>Testing code</li>
<li>Maintaining code</li>
<li>Fixing bugs</li>
<li>Learning and managing idiosyncrasies</li>
</ul>

<p>And more.  Essentially, all the risks that are part of learning a language have now been <em>doubled</em> and are in <em>two</em> separate systems, instead of <em>one</em>, thereby <strong>doubling the risk and associated cost</strong> of a solution that is required to be built using this strategy.</p>

<h2 id="fostering-innovation-and-inspiration">Fostering Innovation and Inspiration</h2>

<p>Why is being an expert so important?  Well, the first quality that comes to mind is exactly that: <em>quality</em>.  An expert developer understands the system on a much more fundamental level, meaning they understand its quirks and deficiencies.  They also understand its pitfalls but more importantly they can start using such knowledge to contribute back and <em>innovate this system</em> and provide even more value back the very entity that granted them expert status in the first place.</p>

<p>From a business perspective, an expert is a better return on investment as they produce <em>higher quality</em> software, one with less bugs and higher functionality.  From a community perspective, an invested, motivated expert provides <em>even greater value</em> because they have the opportunity to further <em>innovate</em> this community, which in turn provides a positive feedback loop to <em>further innovate and inspire</em> the ecosystem in which they attained expert status.</p>

<h2 id="higher-purpose">Higher Purpose</h2>

<p>As I mentioned, I feel that the work we do here is art, which means that on a fundamental level the work we do here has higher purpose.  I have to say that I like where I have seen the latest messaging from this year&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/build">//build</a> (2018) that positions the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-ceo-nadella-the-whole-world-is-now-a-computer/">world as a computer</a>.  That is a pretty inspiring and bold image.</p>

<p>Such a proposition reminds me that I myself had the idea once <a href="http://www.ossem.com/documents/notes/">that the world speaks to us in music</a> that could be captured by monitoring music being played throughout the world at concerts and events, leading to the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is this notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance">resonance</a>?</li>
<li>How is music created?</li>
<li>Does each person have a &ldquo;sound&rdquo;?</li>
<li>What is this &ldquo;sound&rdquo;?</li>
<li>Does each person represent a sound (or vice versa)?</li>
<li>Does a person share the same &ldquo;sound&rdquo; with their friends and family?</li>
<li>Does a person play a &ldquo;song&rdquo;?</li>
<li><em>Does an individual’s “song” resonate with particular people in the past?</em></li>
<li>Does a person find themselves attracted to other people with like or different sounds?</li>
<li>Does a person purchase items from other corporations/entities with a certain type of sound?</li>
<li>Does our species play a &ldquo;song&rdquo; collectively?</li>
<li>Can collective &ldquo;notes&rdquo; be tied to certain events in history?</li>
<li>Is there a &ldquo;code&rdquo; to music?</li>
<li><strong>If so, is there some Higher Entity (God/Universe/Earth) talking to our species through music or vice versa?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Yeahar.  <em>Now that is the stuff right there</em>, in my opinion.  I, of course, am <em>completely</em> biased and oh-so-impressed with my own line of thinking.  But, the point here being that we want <em>experts</em> to land on their own lines of reasoning that lead to big questions such as these.  These big questions are what I consider &ldquo;higher purpose&rdquo; &ndash; ones that art is made to solve (or at least describe) and something that an <em>expert artist</em> can devote their lives to solving or at least contributing.</p>

<p>As such, the goal is to <em>efficiently</em> create these experts at a <em>maximized capacity</em>, providing the necessary support and structure to be able to attain such potential so that they can pursue such interesting and innovative (if I do say so myself) lines of thinking.</p>

<p>All of these big goals and ambitions mean <em>nothing</em> if you do not have inspired developers undertaking the required activities to contribute to the cause.  Additionally, true innovation and discoveries will not occur unless you have <em>expert</em> developers within the .NET ecosystem that are required to continue the cycle and further <em>innovate upon the innovation</em>.</p>

<p>Finally, the more experts you have within a system, the greater the chance you have of not only opening these doors, but being able to confront what is on the other side once they are.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In these pages on the philosophy of the Super.NET project, I covered the important elements of being inspired, of treating software like a craft, striving for elegant simplicity, and prizing a culture of excellence &ndash; as it yields higher quality &ndash; over that of generalists &ndash; which yield lower quality.</p>

<p>By having these components in place, we place ourselves in a position to maximize the potential for the positive feedback of innovation inspiring innovation.</p>

<p>I hope you have enjoyed this section on philosophy as much as I have enjoyed exploring it and writing it for you.  If you are still along for the ride, let&rsquo;s head to the next section where I finally describe the platform we&rsquo;re building here in <a href="/vision/">vision&raquo;</a>.</p>
